        heading: "Introduction",
        content: `Trisomy 13 was first described as the cause of a distinct clinical syndrome in 1960 by Dr. Patau et al. The clinical syndrome was initially characterized as "cerebral defects, apparent anophthalmia, cleft palate, hare lip, simian creases, trigger thumbs, polydactyly, and capillary hemangiomata."
        Patau syndrome, also called trisomy 13, is a clinical syndrome that occurs when all or some cells of the body contain an extra copy of chromosome 13.
        Patau syndrome is diagnosed either prenatally or at birth. Advanced maternal age is a risk for trisomy 13 due to an increased frequency of nondisjunction. However, 20% of Patau syndrome can result from an unbalanced translocation and rarely by mosaicism. Multiple large studies have detailed the poor prognosis of patients with Patau syndrome. Median survival is 7 to 10 days in live-born patients, and 90% live for less than 1 year. Recently, there have been reports of several cases of longer survival due to aggressive medical therapy. Long surviving patients with Patau syndrome are less likely to have cerebral and cardiovascular malformations, typically the primary cause of the poor prognosis with Patau syndrome. Even in these cases of increased survival, severe disability remains the expectation of these patients.`,

Recently, reported cases of longer duration survival have come to light with the use of aggressive medical interventions. Prognosis is better in patients with mosaic Patau syndrome and patients with unbalanced translocations. Aggressive management with surgical and medical intervention may extend median survival to 733 days according to a recent study.`,

        content: `The cause of Patau syndrome is the presence of three copies of chromosome 13; this is due most commonly to nondisjunction in meiosis, occurring more frequently in mothers of advanced age (age greater than 35). Another cause is an unbalanced Robertsonian translocation, which results in two normal copies of chromosome 13 and an additional long arm of chromosome 13. Another less common cause is mosaicism, which results in 3 copies of chromosome 13 in some cells and two copies in the others. Mosaicism is the outcome of a mitotic nondisjunction error and is unrelated to maternal age. Prognosis is better in patients with mosaicism and patients with unbalanced translocations.`,

Facial features include a sloping forehead, small malformed ears, anophthalmia or microphthalmia, micrognathia, and pre-auricular tags. Central nervous system abnormalities are also usually midline, with alobar holoprosencephaly being the most common defect. Common extremity defects include postaxial polydactyly, congenital talipes equinovarus, or rocker-bottom feet.

        The spectrum of cardiac disease in Patau syndrome includes a ventricular septal defect, atrial septal defect, tetralogy of Fallot, atrioventricular septal defect, and double outlet right ventricle. Interestingly, the cardiac defects alone typically are non-lethal in infancy or childhood, even if left untreated.

        Additional organ systems affected by abnormalities include the lungs, liver, kidneys, genitourinary tract, digestive tract, and pancreas. Defects in these organ systems that occur in greater than 50% of patients with Patau syndrome include cryptorchidism, hypospadias, labia minora hypoplasia, and bicornuate uterus. Abnormalities in these organ systems occurring in less than 50% of patients with Patau syndrome include omphalocele, incomplete rotation of the colon, Meckel diverticulum, polycystic kidney, hydronephrosis, and horseshoe kidney.

        Patients surviving past infancy have a severe psychomotor disorder, failure to thrive, intellectual disability, and seizures.`,

Prenatal ultrasound after 17 weeks gestation is most sensitive in detecting the abnormalities of Patau syndrome. Abnormal findings should have confirmation performed with a cytogenetic evaluation of fetal cells.

Trisomy 18 is an autosomal chromosomal aneuploidy caused by an extra chromosome 18, leading to various congenital malformations, and is the second most common autosomal trisomy after trisomy 21. Traditionally, infants diagnosed with trisomy 18 are offered comfort care as the condition is deemed lethal. Recent literature suggests a shift in the management of the condition. Technological interventions are now being offered, with more parents choosing these interventions. Comprehensive care requires a multidisciplinary approach and empathetic support for families to navigate complex medical and ethical decisions.

In the United States, the overall prevalence of Edwards syndrome is approximately 1 in 2500, and the liveborn prevalence is 1 in 8600. The prevalence is higher in females compared to males, with a ratio of 3:2. However, fetal loss is higher in males compared to females, and females have better survival rates compared to males.`,

        content: `Although trisomy 18 remains life-limiting, recent advances in medical care have significantly improved survival rates and outcomes. Approximately 50% of fetuses carried to term are born alive, although 40% die during labor, and one-third of surviving fetuses are delivered preterm. Among live-born infants with trisomy 18, 60% to 75% survive the first week, 20% to 40% survive the first month, and 10% to 19% survive the first year. More recent studies indicate that intensive medical interventions, such as advanced hospital care and cardiac surgeries, can increase 1-year survival rates to 30% to 50%.

Female infants with trisomy 18 have a higher likelihood of survival compared to males, and individuals with mosaic trisomy 18 often experience more prolonged survival compared to those with complete trisomy 18. The primary causes of mortality include cardiac failure due to congenital heart defects and respiratory complications, such as obstructive apnea, pulmonary hypertension, and central apnea. Advancements, driven by increased hospitalizations, surgeries, and technological interventions, such as cardiac surgery, underscore the importance of revising outdated terminology. Although trisomy 18 remains life-limiting, it is vital to adopt language that accurately reflects the progress in care and honors the experiences of affected individuals and families.`,

        content: `Edwards syndrome typically results from an extra copy of chromosome 18q. There are 3 types of Edwards syndrome—complete trisomy 18, partial trisomy 18, and mosaic trisomy 18.

Complete trisomy 18 is the most common form (94%). In this type, every cell contains 3 complete copies of chromosome 18. The extra chromosome is due to nondisjunction, mostly during meiosis II. The extra chromosome is most often of maternal origin. The frequency of nondisjunction errors increases with advancing maternal age.

Mosaic trisomy 18 is the second most common type (<5%). In this type, both a complete trisomy 18 and a normal cell line exist. Thus, the phenotype can range from a complete trisomy 18 phenotype with early mortality to a normal phenotype.

Partial trisomy 18 accounts for 2% of Edwards syndrome. In this type, only a partial segment of chromosome 18q is present in triplicate. The partial triplicate often results from a balanced translocation or inversion carried by 1 of the parents. The phenotype of partial trisomy 18 is variable based on the location and extent of the triplicated segment.

The prevalence of Edwards syndrome is positively correlated with advancing maternal age. The recurrence risk for complete trisomy 18 is 0.5% to 1% for subsequent pregnancies. If 1 parent is found to be a carrier of a balanced translocation leading to an unbalanced translocation in the child, as observed in partial trisomy 18, the recurrence risk can be higher, up to 20%, for subsequent pregnancies.`,

Severe mental retardation in Edwards syndrome may be associated with trisomy of 18q12.1 to 18q21.2.

Most cases of Edwards syndrome are diagnosed prenatally, often through antenatal screening with maternal age, maternal serum markers, or ultrasound findings during the second trimester. Antenatally, Edwards syndrome can reveal intrauterine growth restriction, polyhydramnios, agenesis of the corpus callosum, choroid plexus cyst, nuchal thickening, brachycephaly, clenched hands with overriding index fingers, cardiac defects, omphalocele, and a single umbilical artery. Edwards syndrome has a high risk of fetal loss and stillbirth.

Maternal serum screening can show low levels of alpha-fetoprotein, human chorionic gonadotropin, and unconjugated estriol. Serum and genetic markers are more useful when combined with classic ultrasound findings, such as increased nuchal translucency. For example, noninvasive prenatal testing using cell-free fetal DNA in maternal plasma has a role in diagnosing trisomy 18 but has a positive predictive value of only 60.7% when used alone. Combined with ultrasound, noninvasive prenatal testing has a positive predictive value of 100% and a negative predictive value of up to 100% by the second trimester. Amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is recommended if the antenatal screening suggests a high risk for fetal aneuploidy.

Postnatally, phenotypic variation and clinical presentation guide the evaluation. Diagnostic imaging studies, such as ultrasonography, can assess intracranial, cardiac (echocardiogram), intra-abdominal, and renal abnormalities; however, circumstances dictate the study of choice. Screening is essential in these patients, as anomalies often involve multiple organ systems. Although the diagnosis is typically clinical, karyotyping can confirm trisomy, and microarray testing provides more detailed information about mosaicism.`,

An individualized approach should be considered for each patient, giving the utmost importance to the parental choices in the child's best interests.

Delivery room and neonatal intensive care unit management: Previously, trisomy 18 was considered lethal, and resuscitation at birth was not indicated. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the recent Neonatal Resuscitation Program guidelines no longer advocate withholding active management, including resuscitative efforts in the delivery room.
Feeding management: Nasogastric tube feeding and gastrostomy feeding are considered to address feeding issues. Gastroesophageal reflux can be initially managed with medical therapy and later with surgical options if refractory.
Cardiac management: Diuretics and digoxin are used for heart failure. Palliative and corrective cardiac surgery is recommended for complex congenital heart defects.
Infections: The standard approach to treating respiratory infections, pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and otitis media is recommended.

There are different hypotheses related to the genetic basis of Down syndrome and the association of different genotypes with the phenotypes. Among them is gene dosage imbalance, in which there is an increased dosage or number of genes of Hsa21, which results in increased gene expansion. It further includes the possibility of association of different genes with different phenotypes of Down syndrome. The other popular hypothesis is the amplified development instability hypothesis, according to which the genetic imbalance created by a number of trisomic genes results in a greater impact on the expression and regulation of many genes.\n\nThe critical region hypothesis is also well-known in this list. Down syndrome critical regions (DSCR) are a few chromosomal regions that are associated with partial trisomy for Has21. DSCR on 21q21.22 is responsible for many clinical features of Down syndrome. After a thorough study of different analyses, it became clear that a single critical region gene cannot cause all the phenotypical features associated with trisomy 21, rather it is more evident that multiple critical regions or critical genes have a role to play in this phenomenon.",

          "There are different methods used for the prenatal diagnosis of Down syndrome. Ultrasound, between 14 and 24 weeks of gestation, can be used as a tool for diagnosis based on soft markers like increased nuchal fold thickness, small or no nasal bone, and large ventricles. Nuchal translucency (NT) is detected by ultrasound and is caused by a collection of fluid under the skin behind the fetal neck. It is done between 11 and 14 weeks of gestation. Other causes of this finding include trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), trisomy 18 (Edwards syndrome), and Turner syndrome. Amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling have widely been used for the diagnosis, but there is a small risk of miscarriages between 0.5% to 1%.\n\nSeveral other methods have also been developed and are used for the rapid detection of trisomy 21 both during fetal life and after birth. The FISH of interphase nuclei is most commonly used by either using Hsa21-specific probes or the whole of the Hsa21. Another method that is currently being used is QF-PCR, in which the presence of 3 different alleles is determined by using DNA polymorphic markers. The success of this method depends upon the informative markers and the presence of DNA. It has been found that up to 86.67% of cases of Down syndrome can be identified by using the STR marker method.\n\nA relatively new method called paralogue sequence quantification (PSQ) uses the paralogue sequence on the Hsa21 copy number. It is a PCR-based method that uses the paralogue genes to detect the targeted chromosome number abnormalities, which is known as paralogue sequence quantification.\n\nThere are non-invasive prenatal diagnostic methods that are being studied to be used for the diagnosis of Down syndrome prenatally. These are based on the presence of fetal cells in the maternal blood and the presence of cell-free fetal DNA in the maternal serum.\n\nCell-free fetal DNA makes up 5% to 10% of the maternal plasma, and it increases during pregnancy and clears after delivery. Though this method has been used to determine fetal Rh status in Rhive women, sex in sex-linked disorders, and for the detection of paternally inherited autosomal recessive and dominant traits, its use for the detection of chromosomal aneuploidy, especially the trisomy is still a challenge.\n\nFew other recent methods like digital PCR and next-generation sequencing (NGS) are also being developed for the diagnosis of Down syndrome.",

        heading: "Clinical Features",
        content: `Different clinical conditions are associated with Down syndrome as different systems are affected by it. These patients have a wide array of signs and symptoms like intellectual and developmental disabilities or neurological features, congenital heart defects, gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities, characteristic facial features, and abnormalities.
Congenital Cardiac Defects (CHD)
Congenital cardiac defects are by far the most common and leading cause associated with morbidity and mortality in patients with Down syndrome, especially in the first 2 years of life. Though different suggestions have been made about the geographical as well as seasonal variation in the occurrence of different types of congenital cardiac defects in trisomy 21, so far none of the results have been conclusive.
The incidence of CHD in babies born with Down syndrome is up to 50%. The most common cardiac defect associated with Down syndrome is an atrioventricular septal defect (AVSD), and this defect makes up to 40% of the congenital cardiac defects in Down syndrome. It is said to be associated with the mutation of the non-Hsa21 CRELD1 gene. The second most common cardiac defect in Down syndrome is a ventricular septal defect (VSD), which is seen in about 32% of the patients with Down syndrome. Together with AVSD, these account for more than 50% of congenital cardiac defects in patients with Down syndrome.
The other cardiac defects associated with trisomy 21 are secundum atrial defect (10%), tetralogy of Fallot (6%), and isolated PDA (4%), while about 30% of the patients have more than one cardiac defect. There is geographical variation in the prevalence of the cardiac defect in Down syndrome, with VSD being the most common in Asia and secundum type ASD in Latin America. The reason behind this difference in the prevalence of different types of CHD in different regions is still unclear, and many factors such as regional proximity have been found to contribute.
Because of such a high prevalence of CHD in patients with Down syndrome, it has been recommended that all patients get an echocardiogram within the first few weeks of life.
Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract Abnormalities
Patients with trisomy 21 have many structural and functional disorders related to the GI tract. Structural defects can occur anywhere from the mouth to anus, and it has been found that certain defects like duodenal and small bowel atresia or stenosis, annular pancreas, imperforate anus, and Hirschsprung disease occur more commonly in these patients as compared to the general population.
About 2% of patients with Down syndrome have Hirschsprung disease while 12% of patients with Hirschsprung disease have Down syndrome. Hirschsprung disease is a form of functional lower intestinal obstruction in which the neural cells fail to migrate to the distal segment of the rectum resulting in an aganglionic segment which does not have normal peristalsis resulting in failure of normal defecation reflex causing a functional obstruction. The infant usually presents with signs and symptoms related to intestinal obstruction. Duodenal atresia and imperforate anus usually present in the neonatal period.
Apart from the structural defects patients with Down syndrome, patients are also prone to many other GI disorders like gastroesophageal reflux (GERD), chronic constipation, intermittent diarrhea, and celiac disease. Since there is a strong association of celiac disease with Down syndrome being present in about 5% of these patients, it is recommended to do yearly screening of celiac disease. Once diagnosed, these patients will have to remain on a gluten-free diet for the rest of life.
Hematologic Disorders
There are several hematological disorders associated with Down syndrome. The hematological abnormalities in a newborn with Down syndrome (HANDS) constitute neutrophilia, thrombocytopenia, and polycythemia, which are seen in 80%, 66% and 34% of Down syndrome babies respectively. HANDS is usually mild and resolves within the first thr3e weeks of life.
The other disorder that is quite specific to Down syndrome is a transient myeloproliferative disorder, which is defined as detection of blast cells in younger than 3 month old babies with Down syndrome. It is characterized by the clonal proliferation of megakaryocytes and is detected during the first week of life and is resolved by 3 months of life. It is also known as transient abnormal myelopoiesis or transient leukemia and is known to be present in about 10% of patients with Down syndrome. If this occurs in the fetus, it can cause spontaneous abortion.
Patients with Down syndrome are 10-times more at risk of developing leukemia, which constitute about 2% of all pediatric acute lymphoblastic leukemia and 10% of all pediatric acute myeloid leukemia. Thirty percent of Down syndrome patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia have an association with function mutation in Janus Kinase 2 gene.
About 10% of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia (TML) develop leukemogenesis of acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL) before the age of 4 years. AMKL is associated with GATA1 gene which is an X-linked transcriptor factor leading to an uncontrolled proliferation of immature megakaryocytes.
Neurologic Disorders
Trisomy of Hsa21 has associated with reduced brain volume especially hippocampus and cerebellum. Hypotonia is the hallmark of babies with Down syndrome and is present in almost all of them. It is defined as decreased resistance to passive muscle stretch and is responsible for delayed motor development in these patients. Because of hypotonia Down syndrome patients have joint laxity that causes decreased gait stability and increased energy requirement for physical exertion. These patients are prone to decreased bone mass and increased risk of fractures due to the low level of physical activity, while the ligamentous laxity predisposes these patients to atlantoaxial subluxation.
Five percent to 13% of children with Down syndrome have seizures, out of that, 40% will have seizures before their first birthday, and in these cases, the seizures are usually infantile spasms. Down syndrome children with infantile spasm do respond better to antiepileptics as compared to other kids with the same, and therefore, early intervention and treatment improve the developmental outcome.
Lennox-Gestaut syndrome is also seen to be more prevalent in children with Down syndrome when it does occur, has a late onset, and is associated with reflex seizures along with an increased rate of EEG abnormalities.
Forty percent of patients with Down syndrome develop tonic-clonic or myoclonic seizures in their first 3 decades. Dementia occurs more commonly in patients older than 45 years of age with Down syndrome, and about 84% are more prone to develop seizures. The seizures in these patients are related to the rapid decline in their cognitive functions.
The risk of developing early-onset Alzheimer disease is significantly high in patients with Down syndrome with 50% to 70% of patients developing dementia by the age of 60 years. Amyloid precursor protein (APP), which is known to be associated with increased risk for the Alzheimer disease is found to be encoded on Hsa21, and trisomy of this protein is likely to be responsible for increased frequency of dementia in people with Down syndrome. Recent studies have shown that triplication of APP is associated with increased risk of early-onset Alzheimer disease even in the normal population.
Nearly all the patients with Down syndrome have mild to moderate learning disability. Trisomy of multiple genes including DYRK1A, synaptojanin 1, and single-minded homolog 2 (SIM2) have been found to cause learning and memory defects in mice, which suggests the possibility that the overexpression of these genes may likely be causing the learning disability in people with Down syndrome.
Endocrinological Disorders
Thyroid gland dysfunction is most commonly associated with Down syndrome. Hypothyroidism can be congenital or acquired at any time during life. The newborn screening program in New York has reported an increased incidence of congenital hypothyroidism in babies with Down syndrome as compared to the others. The anti-thyroid autoantibodies were found in 13% to 34% of patients with Down syndrome who had acquired hypothyroidism, and the concentration of these antibodies increased after 8 years of life. About half of the patients with Down syndrome have been shown to have subclinical hypothyroidism with elevated TSH and normal thyroxine levels. Hyperthyroidism is much less frequent in patients with Down syndrome as compared to hypothyroidism, although the rate of it still exceeds the incidence of hyperthyroidism in the general pediatric population.
Abnormalities in sexual development are also noted to be significant with delayed puberty in both genders. In girls, primary hypogonadism presents as delay in menarche or adrenarche, while in boys it can manifest as cryptorchidism, ambiguous genitalia, micropenis, small testes, low sperm count, and scanty growth of axillary and pubic hair.
 The insulin-like growth factor is also said to be responsible for the delay in skeletal maturation and short stature in patients with Down syndrome.
Musculoskeletal Disorders
Children with Down syndrome are at an increased risk of reduced muscle mass because of hypotonia increased ligamentous laxity which causes retardation of gross motor skills and can result in joint dislocation. These patients also have vitamin D deficiency due to several factors like inadequate exposure to sunlight, inadequate intake of vitamin D, malabsorption secondary to celiac disease, increased breakdown because of anticonvulsant therapy, among other factors. These factors increase the risk of decreased bone mass in children with Down syndrome and predispose them to recurrent fractures.
Refractive Errors and Visual Abnormalities
Ocular and orbital anomalies are common in children with Down syndrome. These include blepharitis (2-7%), keratoconus (5-8%), cataract (25% to 85%), retinal anomalies (0% to 38%), strabismus (23% to 44%), amblyopia (10% to 26%), nystagmus (5% to 30%), refractive errors (18% to 58%), glaucoma (less than 1%), iris anomalies (38% to 90%) and optic nerve anomalies (very few cases).
The ocular anomalies, if left untreated, can significantly affect the lives of these patients. Therefore, all the patients with Down syndrome should have an eye exam is done during the first 6 months of life and then annually.
Otorhinolaryngological ( ENT) Disorders
Ear, nose, and throat problems are also quite common in patients with Down syndrome. The anatomical structure of the ear in Down syndrome patients predisposes them to hearing deficits. Hearing loss is usually conductive because of impaction of cerumen and middle ear pathologies, including chronic middle ear effusion due to the small Eustachian tube, acute otitis media, and eardrum perforation. These patients usually require pressure equalization tubes for the treatment.
The sensorineural hearing loss has also been associated with Down syndrome because of the structural abnormalities in the inner ears such as narrow internal auditory canals.

  title: "Human Papillomavirus (HPV)",
  summary:
    "Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection that can affect the skin, genital area and throat. While most infections clear on their own, persistent HPV can lead to genital warts or develop into various cancers, particularly cervical cancer.",
  sections: [
    {
      heading: "Overview",
      content: `Human papillomavirus (HPV) is a common sexually transmitted infection. Almost all sexually active people will be infected at some point in their lives, usually without symptoms. HPV can affect the skin, genital area and throat. 
      Condoms help prevent HPV but do not offer total protection because they do not cover all the genital skin. HPV usually goes away on its own without treatment. Some HPV infections cause genital warts. Others can cause abnormal cells to develop, which go on to become cancer. 
      Cancers from HPV can be prevented with vaccines. The vaccine does not contain any live virus or DNA from the virus so it cannot cause cancer or other HPV-related illnesses. The HPV vaccine is not used to treat HPV infections or diseases caused by HPV, but instead to prevent the development of cancers. 
      Currently, cervical cancer is the only HPV-caused cancer for which screening tests are available. Screening tests are used to check for disease when there are no symptoms. The goal of screening for cervical cancer is to find precancerous cell changes before they become cancer and when treatment can prevent cancer from developing. Screening for cervical cancer is an important part of routine health care for people who have a cervix. This includes women and transgender men who still have a cervix. 
      Cervical cancer is the most common type of cancer caused by HPV, other less common cancers affecting men and women, including anal, vulvar, vaginal, mouth/throat and penile cancers.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Scope of the Problem",
      content: `The highest prevalence of cervical HPV among women is in sub-Saharan Africa (24%), followed by Latin America and the Caribbean (16%), eastern Europe (14%), and South-East Asia (14%). Prevalence in men is highly variable based on sexual trends. 
      Evidence showed that prevalence of the virus is higher among women living with HIV, men who have sex with men, immunocompromised individuals, people with co-infection with other sexually transmitted infections (STI), people who receive immunosuppressive medications and children who have been through sexual abuse. 
      Globally, it is estimated that 620,000 new cancer cases in women and 70,000 new cancer cases in men were caused by HPV in 2019. Cervical cancer was the fourth leading cause of cancer and cancer deaths in women in 2022, with some 660,000 new cases and around 350,000 deaths worldwide. Cervical cancers account for over 90% of HPV-related cancers in women. 
      The highest rates of cervical cancer incidence and mortality are in low- and middle-income countries. This reflects major inequities driven by lack of access to national HPV vaccination, cervical screening and treatment services, and social and economic determinants.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Symptoms",
      content: `Most people will not have any symptoms from an HPV infection. The immune system usually clears HPV from the body within a year or two with no lasting effects. 
      Some HPV infections cause small rough lumps (genital warts) that can appear on the vagina, penis or anus and rarely the throat. They may be painful, itchy or bleed or cause swollen glands. 
      HPV infection that does not go away on its own can cause changes to cervical cells, which lead to precancers that may become cervical cancer if left untreated. It usually takes 15–20 years for cervical cancer to develop after HPV infection. 
      The early changes in cervical cells and precancers mostly do not cause symptoms. Symptoms of cervical cancer may include bleeding between periods or after sexual intercourse or a foul-smelling vaginal discharge. These symptoms may be due to other diseases. People with these symptoms should speak to their healthcare provider.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Prevention",
      content: `Being vaccinated is the best way to prevent HPV infection, cervical cancer and other HPV-related cancers. Screening can detect cervical precancers that can be treated before they develop into cancer. HPV vaccines should be given to all girls aged 9–14 years, before they become sexually active. The vaccine may be given as 1 or 2 doses. People with reduced immune systems should receive 2 or 3 doses. 
      Using condoms during sex is an important way to prevent HPV infection. Voluntary male circumcision also reduces the risk of infection. Being a non-smoker or stopping smoking reduces the chances of developing persistent HPV infection. 
      Testing cells from a woman’s cervix for HPV is used to screen women for cervical cancer. Women should be screened every 5–10 years starting at age 30. Women living with HIV should be screened every 3 years starting at age 25. 
      After a positive HPV test (or other screening method), a healthcare provider can look for changes on the cervix or precancers that could develop into cervical cancer if left untreated. Treatment of precancers prevents cervical cancer. Precancers rarely cause symptoms, which is why regular screening to check cervical health is important.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "Treatment and Management",
      content: `There is currently no treatment for HPV infection. Treatments exist for genital warts, cervical precancers and cervical cancer. Non-cancerous genital warts and precancerous lesions in the cervix, vagina, vulva, anus or penis can be removed or treated by ablation (freezing or heating) or with surgery. 
      Treatments for cancers caused by HPV (including cervical cancer) are more effective if diagnosed early. Treatment should begin quickly after diagnosis. 
      Management pathways for invasive cancer care are important tools to ensure that a patient is referred promptly and supported as they navigate the steps to diagnosis and treatment decisions. A multidisciplinary team should ensure diagnosis and staging (histological testing, pathology, imaging) takes place prior to treatment decisions which could include surgery, radiotherapy and systemic therapy such as chemotherapy. Treatment decisions should be in line with national guidelines and interventions should be supported by holistic psychological, spiritual, physical and palliative care. 
      As low- and middle-income countries scale-up cervical screening, more cases of invasive cervical cancer will be detected, especially in previously unscreened populations. Therefore, referral and treatment strategies need to be implemented and expanded alongside prevention services.`,
    },
    {
      heading: "WHO Response",
      content: `Given the global public health burden of cervical cancer caused by HPV, the World Health Assembly adopted the Global strategy to accelerate the elimination of cervical cancer as a public health problem with the targets: 90% of girls fully vaccinated by age 15; 70% of women screened with a high-performance test by 35 and 45; and 90% of women identified with cervical disease receive treatment. 
      Prevention of HPV-associated precancer and cancer is also a key element of WHO’s Global health sector strategy on HIV, hepatitis and sexually transmitted infections (2022–2030). 
      The joint work of the WHO delivers to: increase political commitment for policy formulation; offer contextualized technical assistance and best practices; develop norms and standards based on latest evidence; and lead the global health ecosystem to achieve targets and improve quality of care.`,
